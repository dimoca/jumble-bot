# jumble-bot

Simple Telegram bot for my own purposes:

  - Download Torrent files to server folder (configured on TorrentDownloadPath). Mostly for downloading with [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Plugins/AutoAdd) or other Torrent client.
  - Kick users when joining to inactive chat.
  - More coming, maybe ... maybe not.

## Configuration
Copy `config.sample.toml` to `config.toml` and edit it.
